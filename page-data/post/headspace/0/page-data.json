I found this to be insightful, in particularly the discussion afterwards. So I decided to start doing these excercises on a regular basis, using Headspace as an introduction and guide. My aim is to write a short reflection after each session to help me get the most out of it.</p>\n<p>I've used the Headspace app for a while in the past; according to my profile I have completed about 55 sessions. I remember enjoying it, but after a while I was in a better place and I didn't feel like it continued to contribute to my wellbeing. I hope by detailing how I feel after each session I can gain a better insight in what it does (or does not) do for me, so I'm curious to see how I will respond to it this time round.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 07, 2019","title":"Headspace - Session 0","categories":["personal"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"post/headspace/0/"}}}
