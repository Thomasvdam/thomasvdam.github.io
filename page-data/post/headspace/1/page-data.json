I don't feel particularly relaxed or more at ease. I guess this is mostly because I wasn't feeling great to begin with, but there's also a part frustration because I couldn't get in 'the zone'. Obviously this frustration is not conducive to getting in the zone, so I'll need to accept that I'm going to need at least a couple of sessions to get the hang of it again.</p>\n<p>I noticed my shoulders and neck were quite tense, and a strong sense of unease in my gut. This sense of unease has been with me since the start of my holiday, but I can't quite put my finger on why I feel this way.</p>\n<p>In the introductory session with my therapist I observed that I have trouble letting my breath 'happen'. Part of the exercise is to observe your breath, counting inhalations and exhalations. I found that when I try to observe it I also start to control my breath; I'll need to manually keep breathing to keep everything going. Luckily I don't always need to focus on my breath, so I know I can do it automatically. I feel like I'm not very good at  observational focus, so to compensate I take control of my breath which forces me to focus...? Something to keep an eye on.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nFrustrated, tense, unease, controlled breathing</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 12, 2019","title":"Headspace - Session 1","categories":["personal"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"post/headspace/1/"}}}
