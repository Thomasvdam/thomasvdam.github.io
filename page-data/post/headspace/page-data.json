I found this to be insightful, in particularly the discussion afterwards. So I decided to start doing these excercises on a regular basis, using Headspace as an introduction and guide. My aim is to write a short reflection after each session to help me get the most out of it.</p>\n<p>I've used the Headspace app for a while in the past; according to my profile I have completed about 55 sessions. I remember enjoying it, but after a while I was in a better place and I didn't feel like it continued to contribute to my wellbeing. I hope by detailing how I feel after each session I can gain a better insight in what it does (or does not) do for me, so I'm curious to see how I will respond to it this time round.</p>\n<h3>Session 1, <em>2019-11-12</em></h3>\n<p>Just completed my first session. I don't feel particularly relaxed or more at ease. I guess this is mostly because I wasn't feeling great to begin with, but there's also a part frustration because I couldn't get in 'the zone'. Obviously this frustration is not conducive to getting in the zone, so I'll need to accept that I'm going to need at least a couple of sessions to get the hang of it again.</p>\n<p>I noticed my shoulders and neck were quite tense, and a strong sense of unease in my gut. This sense of unease has been with me since the start of my holiday, but I can't quite put my finger on why I feel this way.</p>\n<p>In the introductory session with my therapist I observed that I have trouble letting my breath 'happen'. Part of the exercise is to observe your breath, counting inhalations and exhalations. I found that when I try to observe it I also start to control my breath; I'll need to manually keep breathing to keep everything going. Luckily I don't always need to focus on my breath, so I know I can do it automatically. I feel like I'm not very good at  observational focus, so to compensate I take control of my breath which forces me to focus...? Something to keep an eye on.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nFrustrated, tense, unease, controlled breathing</p>\n<h3>Session 2, <em>2019-11-13</em></h3>\n<p>This second session was worse than the first. I had a lot of trouble calming down and even when somewhat calmed down I kept yawning or finding other ways to move. There was a lot of background noise (washing machine, ventilation), which was probably a bit much this early in learning the skill. This led to some frustration, which led to more frustration as I had concluded yesterday that I shouln't get frustrated and just slowly go with the flow and be open to learning.</p>\n<p>I still felt the unease in my gut, but I felt less tense in my neck and shoulders.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nFrustrated, unease, controlled breathing</p>\n<h3>Session 3, <em>2019-11-14</em></h3>\n<p>This session went a lot better. I felt much more at ease to start with, the uneasy feeling seems to have toned down so that probably helped. I still had trouble letting my breathing just happen and observing instead of controlling it, but it's still early days.</p>\n<p>In the last section of the exercise you're supposed to 'let your mind run free', but I can't really figure out what this is supposed to mean. So far I only notice that I stop breathing when I try to do this.</p>\n<p>I feel that part of the difficulty of this mindfulness for me lies in the 'uncertainty' of it all. There is no clear explanation of how it should feel when you're doing it right, so I have a hard time figuring out whether I'm doing the right thing. I don't think there's a lot I can do about that, but it's an interesting observation nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nControlled breathing, strong focus</p>\n<h3>Session 4, <em>2019-11-16</em></h3>\n<p>I skipped yesterday's session due to last minute planning changes. I could have done it in the evening, but it slipped my mind. I'll have to think of a backup moment if my regular schedule is disrupted.</p>\n<p>Today's session went quite well; I felt really relaxed and had a good start, although I had to sneeze halfway through and didn't really get back in the flow after that. I still control my breathing, but I also think I'm starting to get to a point where I can let go of it. I'm excited to see how this will progress in the next few sessions. I suppose it helped that I had a good day yesterday.</p>\n<p>A fun new experience was that I noticed a couple of times that I was distracted and thinking about other things, but only after the fact. It's still progress though, so I'm quite content.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nControlled breathing, relaxed, disrupted</p>\n<h3>Session 5, <em>2019-11-17</em></h3>\n<p>Halfway mark of the basics! I'm pretty happy with my progress so far, even though I still have a long way to go.</p>\n<p>Earlier today I noticed the uneasy feeling in my gut, but to my surprise by the time I got round to meditating I noticed that it was gone. I suppose spending time noodling around on my synthesizers helped in calming down. I need to make sure I figure out a way to get myself to do fun stuff to unwind, and make sure I have the energy I need to recharge, as weird as that may sound.</p>\n<p>I'm still controlling my breathing, I can't quite seem to figure out how to let go of this. The same goes for 'letting the mind go'. I still don't really know how I do this and how it is supposed to feel. This uncertainty was present throughout most of the session.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nControlled breathing, uncertain</p>\n<h3>Session 6, <em>2019-11-18</em></h3>\n<p>Today I noticed the uneasy feeling in my gut again, so it's important for me to do something about that today. Other than that it was mostly more of the same; I'm still controlling my breathing and I still don't really know where I'm supposed to go. It's difficult to figure out if I'm doing the right thing or going about it the right way. I suppose there isn't a clear cut answer to that; maybe that's part of what I need to learn and accept, but it's a little frustrating.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nControlled breathing, unease</p>\n<h3>Session 7, <em>2019-11-19</em></h3>\n<p>I'm divided on today's session. I'm not really happy with how often I got distracted, but on the other hand it does mean that I'm starting to become more aware of it so that's good. :)</p>\n<p>The uneasy feeling was gone, but possibly I didn't notice it over my cold. I guess this cold also contributed to my lack of focus.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nControlled breathing, lack of focus</p>\n<h3>Session 8, <em>2019-11-20</em></h3>\n<p>While yesterday I had trouble focussing on the exercise, I felt like today I had trouble nuancing the focus. Over the previous sessions they keep reiterating that it's important to just let thoughts happen and that getting distracted is natural, so with that in mind yesterday was actually a pretty good day. Today, however, I noticed I was so focused on my breathing that I didn't 'observe' any other thoughts floating around at all. It seems like there's a delicate balance there that I'm having trouble with.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nControlled breathing, strong focus</p>\n<h3>Session 9, <em>2019-11-21</em></h3>\n<p>Today I had another therapy session. We discussed my observations from the previous weeks, which helped figure out a bit better what it is exactly that I'm supposed to get 'better' at. Turns out that the controlled breathing is not that much of an issue, the bigger picture is training the ability to realise when my mind gets 'stuck' in a thought. It's quite motivating now that I know that this is part of the goal and that I'm at a point where I can catch myself on occasion. :)</p>\n<p>I realised that I wasn't very well prepared for the session though, so I'll try and get some better preparation together before the next time.</p>\n<p>I did my meditation afterwards as I didn't get to it in the morning. I noticed that I was quite calm and relaxed, even though a lot of thoughts were racing around in my mind. I caught myself getting distracted a couple of times, so that's good. I feel more at ease with my progress after talking with my therapist, even if I have trouble letting my breathing just go.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nControlled breathing, calm</p>\n<h3>Session 10, <em>2019-11-23</em></h3>\n<p>Missed yesterday's session as I thought I'd be able to slot it in somewhere but that turned out not to be as easy as I thought. I'll have to put a little more thought into it for the future. I want to experiment with meditating on the train, but I fear that it will be too easy to get distracted. I guess I'll just have to get up a little earlier so I can slot it into my morning routine.</p>\n<p>During my session today I noticed that I had a plethora of thoughts running around and that my attention was flicking between them and the exercise I was supposed to focus on. It felt a little overwhelming as the pace was so fast that I didn't even register some thoughts. The exercises talk about stepping back and observing this happening, but I felt like I was right in the thick of it running from thought to thought. I suppose realizing this is a first step into the stepping back, so that's good.</p>\n<p>A couple of times I felt like I was observing my breath instead of controlling, so this also seems a promising progression. Small steps, but it's something.</p>\n<p>Keywords:\nThoughts, thoughts, thoughts</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 21, 2019","title":"Headspace - Sessions 0-10","categories":["personal"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"post/headspace/"}}}
