As far as first posts go this one is pretty unremarkable, but we all have to start somewhere.

I'll update this when there's actually some kind of navigation in place so people can end up here. I'll add some code snippets and talk about the setup of this all.

After some struggles with inline images I managed to create a basic setup for Markdown pages in Gatsby. From here the next steps are creating a paginated listing, filters based on categories, additional templates for different categories, and whatever else I end up wanting.

Regardless, some progress has been made and I've learned a fair bit already, so not at all a bad start. :)
