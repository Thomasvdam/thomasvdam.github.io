Halfway mark of the basics! I'm pretty happy with my progress so far, even though I still have a long way to go.

Earlier today I noticed the uneasy feeling in my gut, but to my surprise by the time I got round to meditating I noticed that it was gone. I suppose spending time noodling around on my synthesizers helped in calming down. I need to make sure I figure out a way to get myself to do fun stuff to unwind, and make sure I have the energy I need to recharge, as weird as that may sound.

I'm still controlling my breathing, I can't quite seem to figure out how to let go of this. The same goes for 'letting the mind go'. I still don't really know how I do this and how it is supposed to feel. This uncertainty was present throughout most of the session.
