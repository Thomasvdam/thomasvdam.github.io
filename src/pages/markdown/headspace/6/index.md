Today I noticed the uneasy feeling in my gut again, so it's important for me to do something about that today. Other than that it was mostly more of the same; I'm still controlling my breathing and I still don't really know where I'm supposed to go. It's difficult to figure out if I'm doing the right thing or going about it the right way. I suppose there isn't a clear cut answer to that; maybe that's part of what I need to learn and accept, but it's a little frustrating.
