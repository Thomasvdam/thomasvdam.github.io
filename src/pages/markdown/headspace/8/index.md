While yesterday I had trouble focussing on the exercise, I felt like today I had trouble nuancing the focus. Over the previous sessions they keep reiterating that it's important to just let thoughts happen and that getting distracted is natural, so with that in mind yesterday was actually a pretty good day. Today, however, I noticed I was so focused on my breathing that I didn't 'observe' any other thoughts floating around at all. It seems like there's a delicate balance there that I'm having trouble with.
