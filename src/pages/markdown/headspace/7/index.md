I'm divided on today's session. I'm not really happy with how often I got distracted, but on the other hand it does mean that I'm starting to become more aware of it so that's good. :)

The uneasy feeling was gone, but possibly I didn't notice it over my cold. I guess this cold also contributed to my lack of focus.
