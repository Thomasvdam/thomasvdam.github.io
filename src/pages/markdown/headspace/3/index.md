This session went a lot better. I felt much more at ease to start with, the uneasy feeling seems to have toned down so that probably helped. I still had trouble letting my breathing just happen and observing instead of controlling it, but it's still early days.

In the last section of the exercise you're supposed to 'let your mind run free', but I can't really figure out what this is supposed to mean. So far I only notice that I stop breathing when I try to do this.

I feel that part of the difficulty of this mindfulness for me lies in the 'uncertainty' of it all. There is no clear explanation of how it should feel when you're doing it right, so I have a hard time figuring out whether I'm doing the right thing. I don't think there's a lot I can do about that, but it's an interesting observation nonetheless.
