This second session was worse than the first. I had a lot of trouble calming down and even when somewhat calmed down I kept yawning or finding other ways to move. There was a lot of background noise (washing machine, ventilation), which was probably a bit much this early in learning the skill. This led to some frustration, which led to more frustration as I had concluded yesterday that I shouln't get frustrated and just slowly go with the flow and be open to learning.

I still felt the unease in my gut, but I felt less tense in my neck and shoulders.
